## Quick Start

### Install dependencies

You'll need:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (see [`.node-version`](.node-version))

### Install local Certificate Authority

```sh
# Install mkcert on macOS
brew install mkcert
brew install nss
```

```sh
# Install mkcert on Windows
# First ensure you have Chocolately installed (https://chocolatey.org/install), then:
choco install mkcert
```

_For other operating systems, see the [mkcert installation guide](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)._

### Set up environment variables

> [!TIP]
> If you already have a Vercel project with development environment variables set up, you can skip this step. When you run `pnpm dev` you will be prompted to pull the environment variables from Vercel.

Copy `.env.local.sample` to `.env.local`, then fill in values for:

<details>
<summary>Clerk</summary>

1. Go to [clerk.com](https://clerk.com) and create a new app.
1. Name the app and set login methods to: **Email, Google, Apple, GitHub**.
