title: Self Hosting
description: Get started by hosting Helper on Vercel
---

Helper is intended to be deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

<Callout type="warn">Self hosting is a work in progress. Please let us know if you find issues or gaps!</Callout>

1. Fork the repository.
1. Create a Vercel project and import your fork.
1. Connect essential services:
   - [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
   - [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/cloud)
1. Set up environment variables for required integrations (see the [README](https://github.com/antiwork/helper/blob/main/README.md#set-up-environment-variables) and [development guide](/docs/development#optional-integrations) for instructions).

Vercel will automatically build and deploy your fork upon pushing to the main branch.

You can optionally set up preview branches as long as your services support it.

<Callout>
  The script in `vercel.json` will automatically seed the database with sample data on preview branches. After that, the
  database will continue attempting to apply migrations, but it will not clear/re-seed the database. If you want a clean
  slate on the preview branch without creating a new PR, then you can temporarily modify `build:preview` in
  `package.json` to include `pnpm db:reset`, commit/push to Github, and then after the Vercel build completes, you can
  commit/push a revert commit.
