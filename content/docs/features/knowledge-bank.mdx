# Knowledge Bank

The knowledge bank is a powerful feature that allows you to add instructions for the AI about how to answer customer messages. These instructions are included in the prompt when generating AI responses, helping to ensure consistent, accurate, and helpful replies.

## How Knowledge Bank Works

When a user sends a message, Helper retrieves relevant knowledge bank entries and adds them to the system prompt before generating an AI response. This process:

1. Finds all enabled knowledge bank entries for your mailbox
2. Formats them into a special instruction section in the prompt
3. Uses these instructions to guide the AI when crafting responses

The knowledge bank helps Helper maintain consistency in how it handles specific topics, answers common questions, and follows your organization's policies.

## Creating Effective Knowledge Bank Entries

Knowledge bank entries work best when they are:

- **Clear and direct** - Provide straightforward instructions that the AI can easily follow
- **Focused on one topic** - Generally, each entry should address a single topic or issue
- **Concise** - Aim for roughly one instruction per entry, up to a few sentences
- **Specific** - Include specific details about how to handle certain questions or situations

You can format entries however you like - there's no strict rule. However, shorter and more focused entries tend to be more effective than lengthy ones.

## Example Knowledge Bank Entries

Here are some examples of effective knowledge bank entries:

```
When asked about pricing, always mention our three tiers: Basic ($10/mo), Pro ($25/mo), and Enterprise (custom pricing).
```

```
Never share specific customer information or order details with other customers.
```

```
If a user reports an issue with login, first ask them to clear their browser cache and cookies before suggesting other troubleshooting steps.
```

## Improving Knowledge Bank with Feedback

Helper can suggest improvements to your knowledge bank based on feedback about AI responses:

1. When you click the "Flag as bad" button on an AI message, you're prompted to provide a reason
2. Helper analyzes the flagged message and your feedback
3. The system may suggest creating a new knowledge bank entry or updating an existing one
4. These suggestions help refine how the AI responds to similar situations in the future

This feedback loop continually improves Helper's responses over time, making the AI more aligned with your expectations and requirements.

## Managing Knowledge Bank Entries

You can add, edit, and remove knowledge bank entries from your mailbox settings. Entries can be enabled or disabled as needed, allowing you to experiment with different instructions and see how they affect AI responses.
