# Local Development Guide

> [!TIP]
> Make sure you follow the Quick Start in the [README](/README.md) first!

## Docker Services

The app uses Docker to run the following services locally:

- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Inngest
- Minio
- Nginx (allowing you to use the `https://helperai.dev` domain)

`pnpm dev` will automatically start and stop these services, or you can use `pnpm services:start` and `pnpm services:stop` to start and stop them manually.

> [!TIP]
> Nginx will attempt to listen on port 80 and 443, so if you have other containers or services running on those ports you will need to stop them first.

## Database Management

Seed the database with sample data:

```sh
pnpm db:reset
```

Generate/run database migrations:

```sh
# Generate a migration to bring the database schema in sync with the definitions in db/schema
pnpm db:generate

# Apply any new migrations to the database
pnpm db:migrate
```

Note that `pnpm dev` will automatically run migrations, but won't generate them.

## Testing

```sh
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run a specific test file
pnpm test tests/inngest/functions/postEmailToGmail.test.ts
```

## Background Tasks

This project uses [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/) for background tasks. You can view the dashboard / development server at [http://localhost:8288/](http://localhost:8288/).

## Email Development

While email sending/receiving in a customer's inbox happens through Gmail, all other emails get sent using Resend and are defined at `lib/emails`. To preview an email, you can visit http://localhost:3060. You can also send yourself a preview email using the "Send" button (note that some assets like images may not properly display when sending a preview email during local development).

## SSL certificates

The app uses a local Certificate Authority (CA) to generate SSL certificates for the `https://helperai.dev` domain.

The certificates will be automatically generated when you run `pnpm dev` for the first time, but if you need to regenerate them you can use:

```sh
pnpm generate-ssl-certificates
```

## Optional Integrations

These integrations are optional for local development but required to make Helper work correctly in production:

<details>
<summary>Resend (transactional emails)</summary>

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com) and sign up or log in.
2. Navigate to "API Keys".
3. Click "Create API Key". Give it a name (e.g., "Helper Dev") and grant it "Sending access" permission.
4. Add the API key to your `.env.local` file as `RESEND_API_KEY`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Google OAuth (sending via Gmail)</summary>

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
4. Click "Create Credentials" and select "OAuth client ID".
5. Choose "Web application" as the application type.
6. Add `https://helperai.dev/api/connect/google/callback` to the "Authorized redirect URIs".
7. Click "Create". You will be shown the Client ID and Client Secret.
8. Add these values to your `.env.local` file as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
9. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library".
10. Search for "Gmail API" and enable it for your project.
11. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen".
12. Configure the consent screen. Under "Data access", add the `.../auth/gmail.send` scope.
13. Add your Google account email address as a Test User under "Audience" while the app is in testing mode.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Google Pub/Sub (receiving from Gmail)</summary>

_This setup allows the app to receive real-time notifications (e.g., new emails) from Gmail during local development._

**1.** Set up and start [Serveo](https://serveo.net), [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started) or similar to get a public forwarding URL pointing to `localhost:3010`.

**2.** Set up Google Pub/Sub:

- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and select the same project used for Google OAuth.
- Navigate to "Pub/Sub" > "Topics".
- Click "Create Topic". Give it a name (e.g., `helper-email-dev`) and click "Create".
- Add the topic name to your `.env.local` file as `GOOGLE_PUBSUB_TOPIC_NAME`.
- Grant the Gmail service account permission to publish to this topic:
  - Go back to the "Topics" list and check the box next to your new topic.
  - Click "Permissions" in the info panel on the right (or click the topic name and go to the Permissions tab).
  - Click "Add Principal".
  - In the "New principals" field, enter `gmail-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com`.
  - Assign the role "Pub/Sub Publisher".
  - Click "Save".
- Create a service account for the push subscription authentication:
  - Go to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts".
  - Click "Create Service Account".
  - Give it a name (e.g., `pubsub-push-auth-dev`) and an ID. Click "Create and Continue".
  - Grant the service account the "Service Account Token Creator" role (`roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`). This allows it to generate OIDC tokens for authentication. Click "Continue" and "Done".
  - Add the service account email (e.g., `pubsub-push-auth-dev@<your-project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) to your `.env.local` file as `GOOGLE_PUBSUB_CLAIM_EMAIL`
- Create the push subscription:
  - Navigate to "Pub/Sub" > "Subscriptions".
  - Click "Create Subscription".
  - Give it an ID (e.g., `helper-email-subscription-dev`).
  - Select the Pub/Sub topic you created earlier (e.g., `helper-email-dev`).
  - Under "Delivery type", select "Push".
  - In the "Endpoint URL" field, enter your forwarding URL followed by the webhook path: `https://<your-forwarding-url>/api/webhooks/gmail` (replace `<your-forwarding-url>` with the URL from step 1).
  - Check the box for "Enable authentication".
  - Select the service account you just created (e.g., `pubsub-push-auth-dev@<your-project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`).
  - Leave other settings as default and click "Create".

Now linking your Gmail account from Settings â†’ Integrations should grant Gmail access and webhooks for new emails should arrive on your local server.

```js
const SECRET_KEY = "<secret key>";
const EXPIRY_TIME = 300; // Signature expiry time in seconds (5 minutes)

async function verifySignature(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const targetUrl = url.searchParams.get("url");
  const passedSignature = url.searchParams.get("verify");
  const expires = url.searchParams.get("expires");

  if (!targetUrl || !passedSignature || !expires) {
    return false;
  }

  const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000); // Current time in seconds
  if (now > parseInt(expires, 10)) {
    return false; // Expired request
  }

  // Compute expected HMAC signature
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();
  const key = await crypto.subtle.importKey(
    "raw",
    encoder.encode(SECRET_KEY),
    { name: "HMAC", hash: "SHA-256" },
    false,
    ["sign"],
  );

  const dataToSign = `${targetUrl}:${expires}`;
  const signatureData = encoder.encode(dataToSign);
  const signatureBuffer = await crypto.subtle.sign("HMAC", key, signatureData);
  const expectedSignature = btoa(String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(signatureBuffer)))
    .replace(/\+/g, "-")
    .replace(/\//g, "_")
    .replace(/=+$/, ""); // URL-safe Base64 encoding

  return expectedSignature === passedSignature;
}

export default {
  async fetch(request) {
    if (!(await verifySignature(request))) {
      return new Response("Forbidden: Invalid or expired signature", { status: 403 });
    }

    const url = new URL(request.url);
    const targetUrl = url.searchParams.get("url");

    try {
      const response = await fetch(targetUrl, {
        method: request.method,
        headers: request.headers,
      });

      const newHeaders = new Headers(response.headers);
      const allowedOrigins = ["https://helper.ai", "https://helperai.dev"];
      const origin = request.headers.get("Origin");

      if (allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
        newHeaders.set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", origin);
      }

      newHeaders.set("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET");
      newHeaders.set("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "*");
      newHeaders.set("X-Proxy-By", "Helper Content Proxy");

      return new Response(response.body, {
        status: response.status,
        headers: newHeaders,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      return new Response(`Error: ${error.message}`, { status: 500 });
    }
  },
};
```

2. Add the following values to your `.env.local` file:
