description: Configure custom reverse proxy setups for local development

We use nginx for local development with HTTPS, listening on port 80 and 443. If you use a similar method to run other apps locally, these ports can conflict.

In this case, you can add a `helperai.dev` listener to your other project's nginx (or other reverse proxy) and run the reverse proxy in Docker with the label `com.antiwork.helper.proxy`.

If a container with that label is running, Helper won't start its own nginx and will expect you to handle the routing yourself.

See [Gumroad](https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad) for an example:

- [Labelled container in the Docker Compose file]()
