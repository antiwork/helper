## Turbo (Rails, Stimulus)

If you're using Turbo with Rails or other frameworks, you'll need to handle page navigation events to properly initialize and destroy the widget:

```javascript
const config = {
  // ... your configurations
};

document.addEventListener("turbo:load", async () => {
  try {
    HelperWidget.destroy();
    await HelperWidget.init(config);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during Turbo load:", error);
  }
});
```

Since Turbo replaces the entire document's body on navigation, reinitializing the widget ensures it functions correctly across pages, avoids DOM conflicts, and maintains consistent behavior.

We'd love to help you integrate Helper with your framework! If you have a working integration example for a framework not listed here, please let us know and we'll add it to this page.

Contact us through the chat widget or reach out to our support team with your integration example.

## General Integration Guidelines

For any JavaScript framework or library:

1. **Initialize the widget** when your page/component mounts
2. **Destroy the widget** when your page/component unmounts to prevent memory leaks
3. **Handle navigation events** if your framework uses client-side routing
4. **Ensure proper cleanup** to avoid DOM conflicts
